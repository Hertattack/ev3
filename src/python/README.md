# Python application to control EV3 and Powered Up

The reason for writing this code is to have some fun with LEGO Mindstorms and to make my [Lego Zetros Trial Truck](https://www.lego.com/nl-nl/product/4x4-mercedes-benz-zetros-trial-truck-42129) drive itself around.

It turned out to be an interesting journey of discovery and a good way to brush up my Python skills :-)

My experimentation would not have been possible without a lot of help from other sources on the internet. See the [resources](#Resources) section at the end of this README for the list of links.

### Software

See:

* [LEGO Wireless BLE Protocol Implementation](src/poweredup/protocol)

## Setup

This is the record of how I have setup all of the components. I use python 3 on the ev3 by running [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/) on it.

The steps followed:
* Create an sd-card with [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/) on it.
* Pop it in the ev3 and watch the magic happen.
* My intelligence was insufficient to get the internal bluetooth adapter of the ev3 to talk to the Powered Up hub .... so I used my wallet to buy this: [Asus USB-BT500](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-USB-BT500-Bluetooth-Backward-Compatible/dp/B08DFBNG7F)
* In my case I also have an usb-hub installed to be able to use both the wifi-dongle and bluetooth dongle at the same time.
* Next up was installing some software:
  * `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
  * `sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev`
  * `sudo pip3 install bluepy`
* ... more to come ...
